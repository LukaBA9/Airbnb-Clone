# Airbnb-Clone
 Welcome to the Airbnb Clone iOS App, built with Swift and SwiftUI. The app replicates key features of the Airbnb platform, such as property listings, user authentication, detailed property views, and booking functionality.
Tech Stack & Features:
SwiftUI for a modern, declarative UI.
Firebase for backend services, including database, authentication, and storage.
MVVM Architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, testable, and scalable.
Swift Concurrency (async/await) for smooth, efficient handling of asynchronous operations.
This project was developed as a learning experience. Feel free to explore the codebase, fork the project, or contribute!

The app greets you with the beautiful screen where you will be asked to give the neccesary info about your stay.

When you apply your search criteria and initiate the search, a list of listings will appear, displaying key information about each one.

You can update your check-in and check-out dates and guest number at any time. The app will prevent you from selecting unavailable dates or entering a number of guests that exceeds the listing’s limit.

The app lets you save listings you like to your wishlist. If you remove a listing, it won’t be deleted right away—instead, it stays visible until the wishlist view is reloaded, giving you a chance to change your mind. This behavior mimics how the official Airbnb app handles wishlists.

You can add or remove listings from your wishlist directly from the listing details view or from the preview in the listings list.

The app displays the listing’s average rating, along with detailed reviews from other users, and a graph showing the distribution of star ratings.
